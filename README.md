# Wolverine Risk Analytics Dashboard
## Monte Carlo Simulation + Heavy-Tailed Risk Modeling | MADS Capstone Project

## Overview
The Wolverine Risk Analytics Dashboard is an interactive financial-risk analysis environment developed as a capstone project for the University of Michigan Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) program. This application models the behavior of equity returns using Student’s-t heavy-tailed distributions, Monte Carlo simulation, rolling diagnostics, and path‑dependent risk analysis. The dashboard integrates statistical modeling, simulation, and visualization into a unified tool that helps analysts, students, and investors explore equity risk dynamics.

## Key Features
### Core Analytics
- Daily log-return modeling using a fitted Student’s-t distribution  
- Annualized performance metrics: mean return, volatility, Sharpe ratio  
- Risk‑adjusted metrics: Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, downside deviation, Ulcer index  
- Rolling analytics: rolling Sharpe (63 & 126 days), rolling mean returns  
- Monthly behavior: monthly return time series and heatmap  

### Tail Risk & Distribution Diagnostics
- Value‑at‑Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR) computed from Student’s‑t  
- Distribution diagnostics: skewness, excess kurtosis, Jarque–Bera p‑value  
- Rolling VaR breaches  
- Overlay of empirical return histogram and fitted Student’s‑t PDF  

### Drawdown & Path‑Dependent Risk
- Full drawdown curve with max drawdown, current drawdown, and longest drawdown  
- Drawdown event analysis: depth vs duration  
- Recovery metrics: average and maximum recovery times  
- Ulcer index  

### Monte Carlo Simulation Engine
- Thousands of forward-looking simulated price paths  
- Configurable simulation horizon  
- Controls for visible paths vs total simulations  
- Metrics including median terminal price and approximate 95% CI width  

### Regime Modeling
- Volatility regimes (Low / Medium / High)  
- Return regimes (Up / Flat / Down)  
- Timeline heatmaps for both

## Background & Related Work
Financial returns often exhibit heavy tails, skewness, and volatility clustering, diverging from Gaussian assumptions. Heavy‑tailed distributions such as the Student’s‑t more accurately capture these behaviors (Aas & Haff, 2006; Cont, 2001). Monte Carlo simulation provides a flexible framework for expressing uncertainty over future price paths, while drawdown‑based and regime‑based diagnostics help contextualize market risk beyond variance alone (Chekhlov, Uryasev, & Zabarankin, 2005; Hamilton, 1989).
